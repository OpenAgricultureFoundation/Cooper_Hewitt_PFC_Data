# Data Files
There are two sets of data. The `data_2019_05_06_to_2019_09_08.csv` file is from a single machine (`EDU-B57178B9-f4-5e-ab-60-84-4e`)
and only from the first part of the exhibition.

The `OpenAg_CooperHewittData_2019_05_06-2020_01_21.*` files contain data from the entire span
of the exhibition from all three machines that were running. The data is in both `csv` and in `json` formats.

## Image files
The images are no longer available directly from the back end services.
A 7.1 Gb archive of the images is available:

[http://openag.srmoore.org/openag_datasets/openag_cooper_hewitt_images/openag_cooper_hewitt_images.tar.gz](http://openag.srmoore.org/openag_datasets/openag_cooper_hewitt_images/openag_cooper_hewitt_images.tar.gz)

The file should have a SHA256 checksum of `4f80af3d11b7bdea79f34878af20e22f4b69ec4c8f6201f3d1c06c08ed6a5a66`

## NOTE
Due to the large size of the complete data sets, the `OpenAg_CooperHewittData_2019_05_06-2020_01_21.*` files are compressed in a `.zip` file

## Machine IDs
There were three total machines running at the Cooper Hewitt.

### Ice Cube
`EDU-32B65C51-50-65-83-d0-fb-bf` was an 'Ice Cube' which had a clear chassis, and no plants.

### Previous analysis
Previous versions of data analysis use the `EDU-B57178B9-f4-5e-ab-60-84-4e` machine.
The other machine that was growing plants was `EDU-9E5B2BBB-f4-5e-ab-66-95-72`.

#### Missing data
TODO: There may have been some connectivity issues on these machines, without further analysis 
it is unclear if there are any gaps in the data.
